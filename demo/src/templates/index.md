Templates are used to generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that surround your markdown files' content. You can use the templates included with this library, or you can define and use your own [ custom templates](./custom.md).

There is currently one built in template: [default](./default.md).

# Layouts

Each template can define one or more layouts. Each layout has its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A common reason to have more than one layout would be to display pages that are top level pages differently than pages that a sub pages.
