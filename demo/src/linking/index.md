title: Linking
---

- If you have a link that points to a directory then it will load the `index.md` file within that directory.

- If the link points to a specific markdown file then it will load that instead.

- Links can include or exclude the `.md` extension

- If a file and a directory share the same name then an error will be produced during the build.
