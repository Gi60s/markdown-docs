Within your markdown files you can import content from other files using the syntax: `{% import ./path/to/import.md %}`

This can go anywhere in your markdown file's content area and can import any text based file.

**Example**

```md
# Heading

This is a markdown file

{% import ./path/to/import.md %}
```
